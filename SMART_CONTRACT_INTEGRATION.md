## ✅ What We've Accomplished

Your payer dashboard now has **full smart contract integration**! Here's what's been implemented:

### 🔗 **Smart Contract Integration**

   - Direct interaction with deployed LiveLedger contract
   - USDC token handling and approvals
   - Stream creation with blockchain transactions
   - Real-time balance checking

2. **React Hook** (`/hooks/useSmartContract.ts`)
   - Clean React integration
   - State management for loading/errors
   - Automatic balance updates
   - Easy-to-use interface

3. **Updated PayerStreamForm**
   - Real-time wallet connection status
   - USDC balance display
   - Smart contract stream creation
   - Transaction hash tracking
   - Stream ID recording

### 📋 **Deployed Contracts (Arbitrum Sepolia)**

|----------|---------|---------|
| **LiveLedger** | `0xd454ccae2e500ae984149fa4cec6e78f0145fd56` | Main streaming contract |
| **MockUSDC** | `0xf6f61a82856981fe317df8c7e078332616b081ec` | Test USDC token |

### 🎯 **How It Works Now**

   - Duration auto-calculated
   - **Real blockchain transaction executed!**

4. **Track Transactions**
