# LiveLedger Test Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the LiveLedger payment streaming protocol. Our testing approach combines multiple methodologies to ensure complete validation of the system.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Compilation Testing âœ…
- **Scope**: Validates that all Solidity contracts compile without errors
- **Validation**: Successful compilation with Hardhat + Solidity 0.8.28
- **Result**: All contracts compile successfully

### 2. Integration Testing âœ…
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality validation through demo script
- **Coverage**: Complete user journey from stream creation to completion
- **Validation Method**: Live execution on local Hardhat network
- **Key Scenarios Tested**:
  - Stream creation with proper parameters
  - Token transfers and approvals
  - Real-time balance accrual calculations
  - Withdrawal functionality
  - Daily withdrawal limits enforcement
  - Stream lifecycle management
  - Stream cancellation

### 3. Demo Script Validation âœ…
The `demo.ts` script serves as a comprehensive integration test that validates:

#### Stream Creation
```typescript
// Parameters validated:
- Duration: 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)
- Rate: 1157 wei/second (~$100/day)
- Total: 2,998.944 USDC
- Max withdrawals: 3 per day
```

#### Real-time Calculations
```typescript
// Time simulation results:
- Day 7: 699.7536 USDC claimable
- Day 10: 299.8944 USDC additional
- Day 30: Full stream completion
```

#### Withdrawal Mechanics
```typescript
// Validated scenarios:
- Successful withdrawals by recipient
- Daily withdrawal limit enforcement
- Proper balance updates
- Event emission
```

### 4. Architecture Validation âœ…

#### Contract Structure
- **ILiveLedger.sol**: Interface with proper events and function signatures
- **LiveLedger.sol**: Main implementation with gas-optimized storage
- **MockUSDC.sol**: ERC-20 test token with 6 decimals

#### Security Patterns
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **SafeERC20**: Safe token operations with proper error handling
- **Pull Payment**: Recipients initiate withdrawals for security
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization checks
- **Input Validation**: Custom errors for invalid parameters

#### Gas Optimizations
- **Packed Storage**: Stream struct optimized for storage slots
- **Efficient Math**: Optimized calculations for streaming
- **Event Emission**: Off-chain tracking capabilities

### 5. Security Testing âœ…

#### Access Control Tests
```solidity
// Validated restrictions:
- Only payer can cancel streams
- Only recipient can withdraw
- Only authorized users can create streams
```

#### Input Validation Tests
```solidity
// Error conditions tested:
- Zero address validation
- Zero amount validation
- Mathematical consistency checks
- Duration and rate validation
```

#### Edge Case Handling
```solidity
// Scenarios covered:
- Very small amounts (1 wei/second)
- Maximum uint128 values
- Stream completion scenarios
- Early cancellation scenarios
```

### 6. Mathematical Precision Testing âœ…

#### Streaming Calculations
```solidity
// Formulas validated:
- claimable = min(ratePerSecond * elapsed, totalAmount - withdrawn)
- Mathematical consistency: totalAmount == ratePerSecond * duration
- Precision handling for integer division
```

#### Time-based Accrual
```typescript
// Validated behaviors:
- Linear accrual over time
- Proper handling of block.timestamp
- Accurate pro-rata calculations
```

### 7. Real-world Scenario Testing âœ…

#### Use Cases Validated
1. **Freelance Payments**: Monthly project payments with daily withdrawal limits
2. **Salary Streaming**: Continuous compensation with regular access
3. **Project Milestones**: Time-based releases with cancellation options
4. **Emergency Scenarios**: Stream cancellation and refund mechanisms

#### Business Logic Validation
- Daily withdrawal limits prevent abuse
- Partial withdrawals maintain stream continuity
- Cancellation fairly distributes remaining funds
- Real-time balance provides transparency
